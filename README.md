## User Parameters
* ***kerf*** - offset in mm from the contour of the mesh. Dependent on wire diameter, resistance and current.
* ***feed*** - cutting speed (mm/min)
* ***slew*** - speed inbetween cuts (mm/min)
* ***vertical axis*** - axis to slice along
* ***slicing algorithm*** - linear or axisymmetric slicing:
  - axisymmetric is computationally quick, works for rotational parts and testing purposes.
  - linear is computationally intensive, has the highest precision and can manufacture most parts.
